Sysinfo
---

Shows basic information about the CPU, Memory and proccesses running.

Made only to see if I can remeber C. 

How it works
---

Compile the program by running:
```sh
$ make all
```

And execute afterwards:
```sh
$ ./sysinfox
```

Notes
---

This code has not been updates since 2010 and it is less likely that it will ever be.
